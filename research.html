    <h2 align="center">Research</h2>
    <p align="center">The collections of the A. C. Moore Herbarium serve as an important research tool for scientists
      around the world.
      Often material may be loaned to partner institutions for review. This sort of exchange program improves the quality
      of the collection by ensuring that all specimens are correctly identified by botanical specialists.
      Additionally, requesting institutions benefit by having the use of a more comprehensive data set.
      Researchers may find it more advantageous to visit the herbarium if a particularly high number of specimens must be
      consulted.
      For preliminary research, <a href="https://sernecportal.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=147"
        target="_blank">the
        online search feature</a> provides a widely accessible, condensed set of specimen information.

    <h3>Molecular Biology</h3>
    <p>Researchers at USC's Department of Biological Sciences have investigated the anatomy of stem tumors of transgenic
      tobacco plants.
      (See Anandalakshmi R, et al 2000. A calmodulin-related protein that suppresses posttranscriptional gene slicing in
      plants, Science 290: 142-144.)
      Two different species of tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum L. and N. benthamiana Domin, were used in these experiments. In
      tumors of both species, the
      quantity of vascular tissue is far less than in normal stem bases, and primary and secondary xylem elements cannot
      be distinguished. These studies
      shed light on the effect of polarity on the development of tumors, and the characteristics, both anatomical and
      developmental, of plant tumors in
      general. Voucher specimens of all plant materials used in this these experiments are housed in the herbarium. </p>
  
    <h3>Plant Systematics</h3>
    <p>Stachys (the "hedge-nettles") is a genus in the mint family (Lamiaceae) containing nearly 250 species, and thus is
      one of the larger
      genera in the family. It is nearly cosmopolitan in natural distribution, and North America is rich in species
      diversity. Within the
      United States, two large areas are of particular interest in the taxonomy of hedge-nettles, the Appalachians, and
      California. Otherwise,
      every state of the Union has naturally occurring populations of at least two species of Stachys. Most of the
      hedge-nettles are perennials,
      commonly featuring rhizomes, and sometimes tubers. Certain species are important as agricultural weeds. Our research
      has indicated zones of
      intergradation between otherwise easily separated species. Nomenclatural confusion has been the result (as with many
      other groups); we are
      attempting to unravel the morphological limits of these species. </p>
  
    <h3>Floristics</h3>
    <p>Recent research has investigated the rare and threatened species occurring at the Congaree Swamp National Monument
      in Richland County,
      about 15 miles from the University. Although the swamp is highly diverse in terms of woody species, it is relatively
      species poor in
      herbaceous flora, although it features considerable diversity of species in the genus Carex. </p>
