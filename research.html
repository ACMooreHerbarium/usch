<h2 align="center">Research</h2>
<p align="center">The collections of the A. C. Moore Herbarium serve as an important research tool for scientists around the world. 
Often material may be loaned to partner institutions for review. This sort of exchange program improves the quality 
of the collection by ensuring that all specimens are correctly identified by botanical specialists.
 Additionally, requesting institutions benefit by having the use of a more comprehensive data set. 
 Researchers may find it more advantageous to visit the herbarium if a particularly high number of specimens must be consulted.
 For preliminary research, <a href="https://sernecportal.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=147" target= "_blank">the 
 online search feature</a> provides a widely accessible, condensed set of specimen information.

<h3>Molecular Biology</h3>
<p>Researchers at USC's Department of Biological Sciences have investigated the anatomy of stem tumors of transgenic tobacco plants.
 (See Anandalakshmi R, et al 2000. A calmodulin-related protein that suppresses posttranscriptional gene slicing in plants, Science 290: 142-144.)
 Two different species of tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum L. and N. benthamiana Domin, were used in these experiments. In tumors of both species, the 
 quantity of vascular tissue is far less than in normal stem bases, and primary and secondary xylem elements cannot be distinguished. These studies 
 shed light on the effect of polarity on the development of tumors, and the characteristics, both anatomical and developmental, of plant tumors in 
 general. Voucher specimens of all plant materials used in this these experiments are housed in the herbarium. </p>

<h3>Plant Systematics</h3>
<p>Stachys (the "hedge-nettles") is a genus in the mint family (Lamiaceae) containing nearly 250 species, and thus is one of the larger 
genera in the family. It is nearly cosmopolitan in natural distribution, and North America is rich in species diversity. Within the 
United States, two large areas are of particular interest in the taxonomy of hedge-nettles, the Appalachians, and California. Otherwise, 
every state of the Union has naturally occurring populations of at least two species of Stachys. Most of the hedge-nettles are perennials, 
commonly featuring rhizomes, and sometimes tubers. Certain species are important as agricultural weeds. Our research has indicated zones of 
intergradation between otherwise easily separated species. Nomenclatural confusion has been the result (as with many other groups); we are 
attempting to unravel the morphological limits of these species. </p>

<h3>Floristics</h3>
<p>Recent research has investigated the rare and threatened species occurring at the Congaree Swamp National Monument in Richland County, 
about 15 miles from the University. Although the swamp is highly diverse in terms of woody species, it is relatively species poor in 
herbaceous flora, although it features considerable diversity of species in the genus Carex. </p>
