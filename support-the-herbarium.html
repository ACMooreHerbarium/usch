    <p align="center">The services of the A.C. Moore Herbarium are offered free to the public. In order to provide
      quality service and maintain the integrity of a collection of over 130,000 dried plant specimens, we rely on the
      generosity of visitors like you. If you would like to help support our continuous efforts to improve and grow
      this important collection, please consider making a donation. The W. T. Batson Endowment has provided the funds
      necessary to cover student-worker salaries, expenses related to research projects and publications, and to
      purchase software and computers used to maintain our collections database.</p>

          <p>May 7, 2002 marked the 90th birthday of Distinguished Professor Emeritus Wade T. Batson, "Dr. B" to his
            colleagues and students.
            It is easy to recall Dr. B to his former students because they will probably never forget the field trips they
            took with
            him in all kinds of weather. Throughout his career, Dr. B served as the first official curator of the A. C.
            Moore Herbarium
            at USC, and he worked tirelessly to maintain and enlarge it. Today it is the repository of over 110,000
            specimens and provides
            significant service to the Department of Biological Sciences and to the community as well. Citizens throughout
            the Southeast
            and elsewhere may <a href="identification.html" target="_blank">request identification</a> of plants they have
            found, and the herbarium
            provides this service free of charge.</p>
  
          <p>To commemorate Dr. B's long service to the herbarium and to honor him on his 90th birthday an endowment was
            established in the USC Educational Foundation to support the herbarium and assure its continuation as an
            important
            scientific and service facility at USC. Through the efforts of many of Dr. B's former students, colleagues,
            and
            friends throughout South Carolina, the endowment has undergone significant growth, but is still far from the
            committee's initial goal of $200,000. We hope you will want to become a part of this effort. Contributions can
            be
            made online at the link below, or by a check payable to the USC Educational Foundation and marked for the
            Batson
            Endowment for the Herbarium. "Batson" and "Herbarium" must appear on your check in order for your gift to be
            placed in the proper fund. Contributions should be sent to:</p>
  
          <ul>

                Columbia, SC 29208</i></p>
          </ul>
  
          <p>The herbarium for the most part relies on external support from grants and contributions to carry out its
            mission.
            You may be aware that USC and the Department of Biological Sciences face serious budget shortfalls. Be assured
            that
            your gift will be prudently used.</p>
