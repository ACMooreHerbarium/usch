<h2 align="center">How to Support Our Herbarium</h2>
<p align="center">The services of the A.C. Moore Herbarium are offered free to the public. In order to provide
quality service and maintain the integrity of a collection of over 100,000 dried plant specimens, we rely on the
generosity of visitors like you. If you would like to help support our continuous efforts to improve and grow 
this important collection, please consider making a donation. The W. T. Batson Endowment has provided the funds 
necessary to cover student-worker salaries, expenses related to research projects and publications, and to 
purchase software and computers used to maintain our collections database.</p>

<hr>

<p>May 7, 2002 marked the 90th birthday of Distinguished Professor Emeritus Wade T. Batson, "Dr. B" to his colleagues and students.  
It is easy to recall Dr. B to his former students because they will probably never forget the field trips they took with 
him in all kinds of weather.  Throughout his career, Dr. B served as the first official curator of the A. C. Moore Herbarium 
at USC, and he worked tirelessly to maintain and enlarge it. Today it is the repository of over 110,000 specimens and provides 
significant service to the Department of Biological Sciences and to the community as well.  Citizens throughout the Southeast 
and elsewhere may <a href="identification.html" target= "_blank">request identification</a> of plants they have found, and the herbarium 
provides this service free of charge.</p>

<p>To commemorate Dr. B's long service to the herbarium and to honor him on his 90th birthday an endowment was
established in the USC Educational Foundation to support the herbarium and assure its continuation as an important
scientific and service facility at USC.   Through the efforts of many of Dr. B's former students, colleagues, and
friends throughout South Carolina, the endowment has undergone significant growth, but is still far from the
committee's initial goal of $200,000.  We hope you will want to become a part of this effort.  Contributions can be
made online at the link below, or by a check payable to the USC Educational Foundation and marked for the Batson 
Endowment for the Herbarium.  "Batson" and "Herbarium" must appear on your check in order for your gift to be 
placed in the proper fund.  Contributions should be sent to:</p>

<ul><p><i>USC Educational Foundation<br>
Gift Processing<br>
University of South Carolina<br>
1027 Barnwell Street<br>
Columbia, SC 29208</i></p></ul>

<p>The herbarium for the most part relies on external support from grants and contributions to carry out its mission.
You may be aware that USC and the Department of Biological Sciences face serious budget shortfalls.  Be assured that
your gift will be prudently used.</p>
