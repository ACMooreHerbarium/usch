    <p><br>The collections of the A.C. Moore Herbarium are generally organized based on five
			major plant groups. These divisions include: Algae, Bryophytes, Fungi, Lichens, and Vascular Plants.
			Specimen data for each major group are published accordingly to taxon-specific portals. Fern specimen data
			represent a special case and are published primarily within the Vascular Plant portal and duplicated in
			the Pteridophyte portal. All data are shared to data aggregators <a href="https://www.idigbio.org/" target="_blank">iDigBio</a>
			and <a href="https://www.gbif.org/publisher/3124bdd8-b38c-46f0-b354-5e1d2c2cd9d2" target="_blank">GBIF</a>.</p>
	<h3>Collection Strengths</h3>
	<p>Vascular plant specimens make up over 90% of the collections, with the majority of these collected in South Carolina or the Southeastern United States.
		The Henry William Ravenel Collection of Converse College includes important historical collections amassed during the 19th Century ...oldest specimen 1814. Types...

    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>At the A.C. Moore Herbarium, we are dedicated to preserving unique botanical specimens and their use in support of
      teaching, research,
      and community engagement.</p> <br>
  
    <hr>
  
    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <p>Our vision is to serve as a leading resource for botanical information in South Carolina by:</p>
  
  
    <ul id="vision">
      <li>Maximizing our ability to provide for the continued curation, growth, and use of our collections as a
        diverse and dynamic botanical repository.</li>
      <li>Collaborating with other herbaria to facilitate access to collections information and share in the
        development of collections and data management protocols.</li>
  
    </ul>
    <br>
    <hr>
  
    <h3>Core Values</h3>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Preservation - Careful curation of the specimens in the collection is of paramount importance. Staff and
        volunteers work carefully to ensure the specimens and the information they contain will be preserved
        indefinitely.</li>
      <li>Accessibility - Specimen information is openly available and can be accessed in person or digitally, free
        of charge.</li>
      <li>Education - Serving as an essential resource for training future botanists and curators, the collection
        also supports education in both the scientific community and public at large by fostering botanical
        appreciation and discovery.</li>
      <li>Research - As primary reference materials, our specimens provide critical support to a variety of
        research projects. Digitization of these specimens and other relevant materials unlocks research
        potential at a global scale and provides data for countless disciplines and topics not only in science but
        also the humanities.</li>
