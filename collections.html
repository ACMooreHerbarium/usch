    <h1 align="center">Our Collections</h1>
    <br>
  
    <h3>A.C. Moore Collection</h3>
    <p>Approximately 350 specimens in the A.C. Moore Collection represent the foundation of the A.C. Moore Herbarium.
      The bulk of this material was collected originally by Dr. Moore himself. Other material was acquired through Dr.
      Moore's correspondence with other botanists. Most of this material dates from the 1920's.</p>
    <br>
  
    <h3>Type Collection</h3>
    <p>Excluding paratypes, syntypes, etc., the A.C. Moore Herbarium carefully maintains a collection of 31 type
      specimens. These type specimens are extremely important for research as they essentially define a species.
      The description of every new species is based upon a type specimen which is referenced in a publication. The
      description not only includes the physical characters of the species being described, but also the herbarium
      where the specimen may be found along with the specimen's accession or catalog number.</p>
    <br>
  
    <h3>Brookgreen Gardens Collection</h3>
    <p>Consisting of nearly 2,000 specimens the Brookgreen Gardens Collection contains an excellent representation
      of plants from the upper coastal plain of South Carolina. Additionally, there are many early collections from the
      Waccamaw Neck (an area succumbing to the pressures of urban development) and from the Huntington Beach State Park
      area.
      Prominent collectors include G.F. Tarbox and R. Stalter.</p>
    <br>
  
    <h3>H.W. Ravenel Collection of Converse College</h3>
    <p>The vascular plant collection of Henry William Ravenel was entrusted to the A.C. Moore Herbarium by
      Converse College. Nearly 6,000 specimens have been carefully conserved and occupy 5 separate herbarium cabinets.
      Ravenel was a well known botanist during the 19th Century and his collection mirrors not only his travels, but also
      his correspondents who sent him plants from all over the world. Cooperative efforts with the South Caroliniana
      Library
      and the Rare Books and Special Collections branch of the Thomas Cooper Library at the University of South Carolina
      have
      produced a fantastic online exhibit of Ravenel and his collection.</p>
