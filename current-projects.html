  <h3>Molecular Biology</h3>
  <p>Researchers at USC's Department of Biological Sciences have investigated the anatomy of stem tumors of transgenic
    tobacco plants.
    (See Anandalakshmi R, et al 2000. A calmodulin-related protein that suppresses posttranscriptional gene slicing in
    plants, Science 290: 142-144.)
    Two different species of tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum L. and N. benthamiana Domin, were used in these experiments. In
    tumors of both species, the
    quantity of vascular tissue is far less than in normal stem bases, and primary and secondary xylem elements cannot
    be distinguished. These studies
    shed light on the effect of polarity on the development of tumors, and the characteristics, both anatomical and
    developmental, of plant tumors in
    general. Voucher specimens of all plant materials used in this these experiments are housed in the herbarium. </p>

  <h3>Plant Systematics</h3>
  <p>Stachys (the "hedge-nettles") is a genus in the mint family (Lamiaceae) containing nearly 250 species, and thus is
    one of the larger genera
    in the family. It is nearly cosmopolitan in natural distribution, and North America is rich in species diversity.
    Within the United States,
    two large areas are of particular interest in the taxonomy of hedge-nettles, the Appalachians, and California.
    Otherwise, every state of the
    Union has naturally occurring populations of at least two species of Stachys. Most of the hedge-nettles are
    perennials, commonly featuring rhizomes,
    and sometimes tubers. Certain species are important as agricultural weeds. Our research has indicated zones of
    intergradation between otherwise
    easily separated species. Nomenclatural confusion has been the result (as with many other groups); we are attempting
    to unravel the
    morphological limits of these species.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Floristics</h3>
  <p>Recent research has investigated the rare and threatened species occurring at the Congaree Swamp National Monument
    in Richland County,
    about 15 miles from the University. Although the swamp is highly diverse in terms of woody species, it is relatively
    species poor in
    herbaceous flora, although it features considerable diversity of species in the genus Carex.</p>
